## labelled data set

Regression: numerical data

### Classification

KNN: using numerical data to predict a categorical variable
Decision Tree: Using any data to predict categorical data
Logistic Regression: Using data to predict categorical data (0/1)
SVM: Like KNN but lets you split categorical data into different dimensions
     instead of using distance of each point. Groups features using non-linear
     lines.

## Unlabelled data set

### Clustering
Uses: 1. summary generation
      2. Outlier Detection (Credit card fraud detection for example)
      3. Finding duplicates
      4. Exploratory data analysis

K-Means (Partition Based): Used for medium and large sized data sets. Group
        specific features into clusters (bucket). Use numerical data to bucket
        users.
